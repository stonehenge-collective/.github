Stonehenge Collective is a community for building projects. Members apply and are vetted for intelligence, kindness, respect, ownership, and initiative.

Membership is free and gives access to a Discord server where members can meet, propose new projects, and join existing projects.

Projects formed within the collective grant initial ownership and distribute new ownership shares based on contributions to the project. Early ownership can be diluted if the founder does not meaningfully contribute to the project's growth. Stonehenge is automatically given a fixed ownership percentage of 5% in each project formed within the group.

This ownership model lends itself to non-capital intensive/high human capital projects (software), but other types of projects are not precluded.

For now, the collective provides little in terms of project support, outside of the community base. Eventually, it will support the commonalities between projects; setting up LLCs, finances, common tech stacks, and HR. As the collective's support grows, its initial ownership stake in new projects will grow as well. It may also offer initial capital at a fixed ownership cost to new projects.

The collective is itself a project within the collective, with the same ownership model. Collective founders may bring members of the collective in the collective ownership group at any time, through the same "build it, own it" model.
